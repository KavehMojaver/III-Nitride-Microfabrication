# III-Nitride-Microfabrication

This Repository is dedicated to the development of a process recipe for in-house Microfabrication of submicron gate III-Nitride HFETs using optical lithography and electron beam lithography. The fabrication process has been successfully performed at McGill nano-tools micro-fabrication facilities (mnm). For more details, please visit chapter 5 of the following phd dissertation:
